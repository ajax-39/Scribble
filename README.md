## Local Setup

### Prerequisites
### Steps to Setup Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ajax-39/Scribble.git
   cd Scribble

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - **Frontend**:
     ```sh
     flutter pub get
     ```
   - **Backend**:
     ```sh
     cd server
     npm install
     ```

3. **Generate `.env` Files**
   - **In the root directory (`Scribble/.env`)**, create a `.env` file and add:
     ```env
     SERVER_URL=http://<youripaddress>:3000
     ```
   - **In the `server` folder (`Scribble/server/.env`)**, create a `.env` file and add:
